# Network Securtiy
- This project investigates the effect of different feature selection methods on a well-known benchmark in the research of Intrusion Detection techniques (NSL-KDD data set).
- Those methods are Principal Component Analysis, Chi square, Anova F-value
- The Experiments are conducted using two ML models (NB, Logistic Regression) and DNN-4L. These experiments are measured using Recall, Precision, Accuracy, and Training Time.
